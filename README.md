# ML-Plant-Based-Disease-Detection-System
This repository consists of the code files and the datasets for the machine learning model for a plant based disease detection system. As per the statistics of the US government almost every year upto 21% of plantation is destroyed when the farmers are not able to detect a disease in plants or unable to provide the proper treatment to a plant disease due to wrong diagnosis. We have created a machine learning model which trains for the potato plant on a set of disease images and can be used to detect the disease in plant, identfying the closest image in the database to the disease. Identifying these can help farmers to provide particular treatment to a disease well in time, avoiding wastage of the crops. The ML model uses Tensorflow library, generates a confidence score for prediction and has an accuracy of more than 95%. The potato plant dataset can be pretty much replaced with any other crop dataset.
